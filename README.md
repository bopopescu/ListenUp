# ListenUp
Migrated from private repository to public
This is a project I completed in Ionic3. This app allows a user to send public or anonymous feedback to each other. 
It is targeted at public speakers, performers etc who want to improve their performance. 
This was hosted on a private repository, but for the purpose of showing my code, I have migrated it to a public one(current one). 
I wrote most of the code for this app.
It is on app store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/listenup-feedback-done-right/id1382748243?mt=8
